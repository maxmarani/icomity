#summary Automation and icon theme customization.

= Introduction =

*Why one more icon theme?* 

First because the current icon themes are not easily customized.

Second because I am not totally satisfied with the current options. Oxygen icon them, gnome icon theme, faenza and others are great but there are lots of good public designs I would like to fuse or just substitute on them.

= Details =

Most of the tasks involved on building an icon theme and customizing it are still time consuming and error prone. At same time, SVG icons are excellent to mix, match and modify.

Luckily, there are ways to use bash scripts automatize the bulk of the process, like conversion of the icons  to a format more convenient for DEs (PNG) and color substitution.

Also planned is a gui to help on a more detailed customization process.
